# API Gateway 
A simple configurable API gateway for linking microservices to the Tulsa Web Devs User Group site.

For information on currently registered services or how to register a new service, see [SERVICES.md](./SERVICES.md)

Built in Rust and containerized with Docker. 

## CONTRIBUTING
This is mostly a labor of love and learning that we might actually use. There are certainly existing solutions to this problem in the wild already. 

I'm building this in RustðŸ¦€ to get better at my skills in that language and what I percieve as some of its strengths. I hope to learn more about performance optimization, telemetry/observability, and security. 

I'm happy to have friends on this journey who are in the mood to hack on it with me, just send me a message / make a draft PR if you have questions. I'm not going to write a lengthy contributing doc for this(yet)ðŸ˜….

## ROADMAP
### MVP 0.x
- [ ] Define API
- [ ] Containerize for development
- [ ] Build Config mechanism
- [ ] Build Simple Routing mechanism with Reqwest (JWT auth from front end, all just passed username / basic user metadata from Clerk.io, contents TBD)

*as time allows, build the Clerk interface to back pair of auth and metadata services so that the auth/metadata service is configurable*

- [ ] Containerize for deployment
- [ ] Test
- [ ] Deploy

### Future Development
#### High Priority
- [ ] Add reverse proxy
- [ ] Add observability mechanisms (OpenTelemtry/tracing.rs ?)
- [ ] Add auth bypass option for public APIs to config (Auth on by default)
- [ ] Add read/write options to user metadata per service (nested under service name)

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Make any adjustments needed for horizontal scaling in containers
- [ ] Add load balancer 
- [ ] Refactor to use [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) instead of Reqwest.
*[This PR](https://github.com/DarrenBaldwin07/clerk-rs/pull/32) is close and will make this easy to do and more dev friendly.*

#### If Needed
- [ ] Add Redis or other backing service interface for service metadata (separate from auth/Clerk)
